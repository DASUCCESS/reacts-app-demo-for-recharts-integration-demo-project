This is a demo React app that uses Recharts to display a bar chart, pie chart, and line chart using data from a local file.

Installation
To install the dependencies, run:


## Available Scripts

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**  Step 1: Create a new React app
First, create a new React app using create-react-app. Open your terminal and run the following command:

### `npx create-react-app recharts-demo`
This will create a new React app in a directory called recharts-demo. 

##Navigate to the project directory:

## `cd recharts-demo`

**Step 2: Install Recharts

Next, install the Recharts library using npm:

### `npm install recharts`
Runs the app in the development mode.\

** Step 3: Create the Charts data <br>
** Step 4: Create the charts itself 

Follow the file folder guide in the repo and  you will be good to go


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
